## Troubleshooting

### IDE Settings

#### Project Lombok Plugin
When building the project in your IDE (eclipse or IntelliJ), Lombok plugin will be required to compile.

For IntelliJ IDEA, please add the Lombok IntelliJ plugin:
* Go to `File > Settings > Plugins`
* Click on `Browse repositories...`
* Search for `Lombok Plugin`
* Click on `Install plugin`
* Restart IntelliJ IDEA

Plugin setup for other IDE's are available on [https://projectlombok.org/setup/overview]

#### JsonMappingException when running tests in your IDE
Add the `-parameters` setting to your compiler arguments in your IDE (Make sure you recompile your code after).
This is because we use a feature of jackson for automatically deserialising based on the constructor.
